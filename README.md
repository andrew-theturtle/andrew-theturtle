### ðŸ‘‹ You found me!

Hey there! I am Andrew, a full-stack engineer and a builder at heart. Always on the hunt to supercharge my development workflow with awesomeness. Here to craft software that ticks, kicks, and sticks to making a real-world dent.

Away from Vim, youâ€™ll find me mentoring and volunteering â€” championing education and spreading warmth in our community, one connection, one line of code, and one cozy blanket at a time.
